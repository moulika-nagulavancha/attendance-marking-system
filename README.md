In this application, we are going to develop a classroom attendance app shown in below. In the front, there are a whiteboard, TV, and whiteboard where the TV is represented by a set of sliding images. Next, there are a set of seats with studentsâ€™ names. The names are selectable to indicate whether present or absent (all students are present by default). Finally, we have the total absent count below which will be updated when the name is clicked.

Functionalities include:
1. Sliding images
2. Selection and De-selection of the persons
3. Counting the total number of absent students
